Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable and high-performance applications, particularly suited for real-time, data-intensive tasks. It operates on a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, enabling asynchronous processing and making it highly efficient for handling multiple simultaneous connections. Popular for backend development, Node.js supports a vast ecosystem of modules through its package manager, npm, simplifying tasks like building APIs, managing databases, and integrating third-party services. Its versatility and speed make it a preferred choice for developing web apps, chat applications, IoT systems, and more.
